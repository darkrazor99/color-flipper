**Color Flipper - a JavaScript Project by Tarek**

Color Flipper is a simple JavaScript project that allows users to click a button and change the background color of a web page to a randomly generated color without a page refresh. The project uses vanilla JavaScript and no external libraries or frameworks, making it a great exercise for beginner and intermediate programmers.

To run the project, simply open the HTML file in your web browser and click the "Change Color" button. The page will update the background color to a new randomly generated color each time the button is pressed. The script uses the JavaScript `Math.random()` method to generate a random color value, which is then assigned to the `style.backgroundColor` property of the page's `body` element.

This is one of hopefully many projects to get me coding
